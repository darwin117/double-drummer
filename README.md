# double-drummer

Music listening website developed as final group project for our Webpage Development course.

All parts that disclosed any information regarding us or our school have been removed, for obvious reasoning.

Songs and images relating to them also not included, so as not to infringe copyright. 

The exported database file is provided, but stripped of values in most tables for the same reasoning. 

Some file and database table names are written in portuguese, but a lot of class, variable, etc. names are in english and figuring out what's going on shouldn't be too difficult, other than maybe needing to translate some stuff. This means that adding in your own songs, by moving replacement files into the correct directories and inserting their respective information into the database, is pretty uncomplicated, and you could very well turn this into a sort of web-based personal music player.

<h4>Notes:</h4>

Overall this is pretty incomplete, as time constraints prevented us from adding in a lot of features we wanted to but we did at least get the main idea done. Not sure if I'll get back to this at some point (trying to clean up older code after improving even slightly *is* pretty painful after all), but maybe I'll give it a shot when I'm less busy with other projects.

If you see anything that needs improvement (which there is a *lot* of as of writing this), please go ahead and suggest some changes! Even if we don't work on this anymore, we can always apply it to future projects.
